                                                    <p>My name is William Yang, and I am the senior class president of Stuyvesant High School. Do not allow yourself any conception of my character from that title alone, however, for we are variations across an infinite number of strata, infinite numbers of timelines intersecting into a sphere of possibility that positions us at its center. The most tangible thing of this constant becoming is our haecceity, the is-ness of our being that contains us as we shift to different lines and trajectories. 
                                                        <br /> From this state of pure immanence, this body without organs, emerge radically different creations that have no inherent moral purpose. But some of the more beneficial things I have been able to coax into existence from flirting with catatonia include three very successful college trips, stuy.edu emails, a better set of policies for maintenance of toilet paper and paper towels, junior swim gym classes, two chocolate fountains for semiformal, and a relatively decent GPA. 
                                                        <br /> Unlike Plato, I believe that the masses, if educated, do not need philosopher-kings to guide their lives, and can sustain themselves through the institution of democracy. As such, many courses of action I had pursued over the past two years were first predicated upon releasing surveys, online and on paper, to my grade and occasionally the school. Sometimes, however, I wonder if Socrates was right when he claimed, “The unexamined life is not worth living.” But why contest that? Join my philosophy club at Stuy, StuyPhi.</p>

                                                    <p>I go by Danny because in third grade we had three Daniels, and instead of going by “Daniel 1, Daniel 2, and Daniel 3,” we were known as “Dan, Daniel, and Danny.” I have diverse interests and always find myself curious and engaged when learning new information, and always do my best to make unfamiliar topics relatable to me.
                                                        <br />
I enjoy reading, and when I have time I read an entire book in one sitting. Currently, my favorite novel is A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess. I try to remain up to date with current events from the New York Times and other sources.  Apart from my academic hobbies, I enjoy playing sports such as handball, soccer, etc. with friends and go to the gym twice or thrice weekly. 
                                                        <br />
I am very interested in Spanish, and am currently taking my second Spanish AP class and intend to minor in the language when I attend university (ideally UPenn). I am already semi-fluent, and hope to be nearly fluent by the end of senior year. I listen to fifteen minutes of Spanish news (almost) every day on my train ride to school to familiarize myself with Spanish spoken outside of the classroom. 
                                                        <br />
I also have a strong interest in business, specifically in operational management. In 2014, I helped organize and direct teams for two business competitions, one international and one national, in which the teams placed third and tenth respectively. However, I wish to explore different business routes, such as finance and marketing, to broaden my horizons in business and perhaps find myself interested in one of these directions more than management. My sophomore year, I pushed myself to get out of my comfort zone and successfully founded a youth charity organization, PACT (Public Awareness for Charity by Teens). In the future, I hope to study international business and work and live in South America or Spain.</p>
